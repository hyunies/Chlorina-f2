The Role of Chlorophyll b in Barley, Hordeum Vulgare, and the Chlorophyll b-less Mutant, Chlorina f2, in Photosynthesis and Photoprotection

The Chlorina f2 (clo f2) mutant of barley, Hordeum vulgare, is defective in the enzyme chlorophyll a oxygenase and thus, clo f2 lacks chlorophyll b (Nezval et al., 2017). Under “non-stress”, normal light and temperature conditions clo f2 plants function similar to wild type (WT)  plants, however they are slower to grow and produce fewer and smaller seeds (Nezval et al., 2017). While under light stress, the difference is more pronounced and clo f2 plants appear pale and are stunted (Ghirardi et al., 1986). 

The objective of this laboratory experiment was to measure the differences in clo f2 and WT barley to draw conclusions about how photosynthetic pigments, specifically chlorophyll b, function and to understand its role in photosynthesis. If chlorophyll b is important for reducing light damage in the leaf, then the clo f2 mutant lacking in chlorophyll b would fluoresce less in excess light and in recovery compared to the WT barley due to accumulated damage from ROS. Additionally, it was predicted that the lack of chlorophyll b in Clo f2 would lead to lowered productivity and functional pigments after long periods of photoinhibition.
